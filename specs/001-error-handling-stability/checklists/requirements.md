# Specification Quality Checklist: Error Handling and Stability Improvements

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-03
**Feature**: [Error Handling and Stability Improvements](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been verified and the specification is ready for the planning phase (`/sp.plan`).

## Notes

- Specification focuses on observable behavior and user outcomes
- All requirements are independently testable
- Success criteria are measurable without knowledge of implementation
- Edge cases account for common failure scenarios
- Assumptions and out-of-scope items are clearly documented
